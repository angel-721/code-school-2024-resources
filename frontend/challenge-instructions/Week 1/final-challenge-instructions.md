# Option 1: Resource/Reference page for everything learned in the first week

You can expand on the idea of the markdown page containing all of the resources but convert it to html/css

# Option 2: Build a personal portfolio/resume site

Include things like your past projects and structure it so you can add new ones that will be created over the next few weeks.
Feel free to add things you would add to a resume.
