## The Friday Challenge

Use a free api to create a single page web app using Vue.js Options API(The way you just learned how to use Vue this past week)

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0) is a nice GitHub Repo for finding free api's. It will save you time if you choose one that has no authentication.

### Some interesting API's
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Art Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction)
- [ Animal Crossing Songs API](https://github.com/angel-721/acnhapi-music-backup)
  - For this API, Just make a fetch to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angel-721/acnhapi-music-backup/main/songs.json   
- [CoinCap](https://docs.coincap.io/)
- [Yo Momma Jokes](https://github.com/beanboi7/yomomma-apiv2)

### General Guidlines
- You MUST have one fetch call. This will most likely be a GET to your API
- You must work in teams of 2 to 3(max)
- You must use Git so you can Git good at Git
- You must keep it single page
- You will create a way to change the site via clicking and/or typing
- For fun, add a light mode and dark mode feature and use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to save a user's preference
- You must use Vue
