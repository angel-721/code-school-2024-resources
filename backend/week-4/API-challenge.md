# API Challenge

Step 1)
Make a GitHub repo: for your API(e.g cat-names-api)

Your resource must have three fields
- Must have one string type
- Must have one number type
- Can not be expense or student
- You must use a .env file to hold your MongoDB connection
- DO NOT INCLUDE the .env in your repo

Step 1.2)
Make a model.js to hold the model of your data. Define a Schema the same way we have done before and export it to your index.js

Step 2)
Make a API with of one or more resources
  - PUT
  - GET
  - GET a single record
  - POST
  - DELETE
GET the data from a MongoDB instance and save it to MongoDB

Ensure sure that you have data validation with try-catch blocks for each endpoint

Step 3 - Friday:
Swap your API with someone and make a Vue frontend for the other person's API
