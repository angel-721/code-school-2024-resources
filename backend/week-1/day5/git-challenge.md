# Git Project Challenge

Pair up with a partner or two to develop a basic web app together. Keep groups no more than 3 people. You can make whatever you want but keep the scope small.
The purpose of this is to get used to git branches and working with others on the same git repo

## Steps to get started:
1) Have a single person make the project on Github
2) For the person who owns the Repo:
  - Make the ``` develop ``` branch on Github. [Here's a guide on how to do it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) 
  - Go to Settings > Access > Collaborators
  -  Add your partner(s) to the Repo
3) Everyone clones the Repo
4) Get started on working :)
  - Ensure you make a new branch for every new feature. A new feature should be small and simple such as adding a onclick to a button or making a ul in the index.html.
  - PLEASE PLEASE try to avoid working on the same function, in the same file. A new feature should be the scope of a function or a couple of tags in your html file

## Develop Workflow:
Refer to the [Git Guide from me](https://github.com/angel-721/git-names/blob/main/README.md) or [this article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Project Ideas:
  - Workout log
  - Take the existing Wordle code(or another project we did together) and make it better with more features
  - A music player using this API https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angel-721/acnhapi-music-backup/main/songs.json
  - A journal app
  - Connect Four
  - A good movie tracker
  - Restaunt Review Site
  - Blog posting site


Try to keep this small. Focus more on the Git side and making sure that you can work with other's within the same repo. This should be rocky but it's great practice before the final projects.
